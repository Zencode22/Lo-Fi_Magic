# Lo‑Fi Magic  

*Puzzle‑platformer built with Godot*  

---  

## Overview  

**Lo‑Fi Magic** is a minimalist puzzle‑platformer where players explore hand‑crafted levels, collect **Sound Tokens**, and use them to unlock gates that open the path to the next stage.  

---  

## Gameplay  

- **Collect Sound Tokens** – Wander the environment, solve platforming challenges, and gather the hidden tokens scattered throughout each level.  
- **Unlock Gates** – Once enough tokens are collected, interact with the glowing gate to open it and advance.  
- **Ambient Lo‑Fi Soundtrack** – Every token contributes to a layered lo‑fi soundtrack that evolves as you play, reinforcing the game’s soothing aesthetic.
